# System
#

Overview
System runs the library system. For each library branch there is e.g. arden library, epping library, a new system object is instantsiated. It houses all of the dictionaries holding all objects.

Functions
init - initializes the system
newItem - adds a new item created in the system to all of the dictionaries
printItems - prints the {Name: Object location} dictionary

#
# Item
#

Overview
Item is the Parent class of all items, it is parent to Book, DVD, Magazine. Items populate the library with objects.

Functions
init - initializes the system, if an ID is not provided, one will be created for it. Uses the systems function newItem
str - magic method that returns data about the item
display_info - Displays some info about the item
borrow_item - sets the items available state to false if possible, otherwise throws error
return_item - sets the items available state to true if possible, otherwise throws error
delete - deletes item from all dictionaries and lists in the system

#
# Book, DVD, Magazine
#

Overview
All these classes do the same thing, but with slightly different attributes. They are all child to Item.

Functions
init - Initializes by using the super method, which INHERITS the Item class, then adds the other specific attributes
display_info - uses POLYMORPHISM to override the parent class and display more specific info about the item

# #

System is needed for Item, but item does not inherit from system.

           System

            Item
             |
             |
             |
            \ /
    Book, DVD, Magazine

Welcome to the canned behaviour, to continue, press enter
All instructions and comments are in green, outputs from the program are in black
To begin we first instantsiate a System object
System is created, lets populate it with an item
Name: Children's Elmo Toy
Item type: Item
ID: ALI1
Available: 游릴
This object is an 'Item', and was automatically assigned an ID
Let's add some more objects
Name: Harry Potter
Item type: Book
ID: JKR500
Author: J.K. Rowling
Available: 游릴
Pages: 200
Genre: Fantasy
This object comes from the Book class, and this time we assigned it an ID
The Book class inherits from the Item class. DVD and Magazine also do this
These three child classes use polymorphism to change the methods encapsulated in the object
You can see when the Book displayed it's info it was able to display more specific information
Let's try borrowing it now
Harry Potter has been successfully borrowed
Let's have a look at it's status
Name: Harry Potter
Item type: Book
ID: JKR500
Author: J.K. Rowling
Available: 游린
Pages: 200
Genre: Fantasy
Now let's see what happens if we try borrow it again
This item is not available
Isn't that clever, let's make sure the availability status is still correct
Name: Harry Potter
Item type: Book
ID: JKR500
Author: J.K. Rowling
Available: 游린
Pages: 200
Genre: Fantasy
Let's have a look at all the records now
{"Children's Elmo Toy": <classes.item.Item object at 0x7ac30c4f3170>, 'Harry Potter': <classes.book.Book object at 0x7ac30c4f3a70>}
